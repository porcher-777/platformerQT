# Heaven's Door

Mini project for the end of S4 at ISEN Rennes.

The goal is to create a platformer game or level in which the goal is to collect all the "souls" on the character's path and then arrive at  heaven's doors in order to reach a good end as quickly as possible.

The score of the best player will then be saved and displayed at the end.

Falling into the void, losing all your life points or reaching the door without the 10 souls needed will be counted as a failure.
